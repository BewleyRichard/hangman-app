## Description 

In this task, I created a React app that allows users to play the hangman game.  

## Getting started 

In the project directory, please run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app in your browser.

## Rules of the game  

The game picks a random word from a dictionary of planets. You must then attempt to guess the planet letter-by-letter to identify it. Too many incorrect guesses results in the loss of the game. You can make a maxium of 10 incorrect guesses until your character is hanged!
